# Python API Weather Analysis

---

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to utilise Python requests APIs and JSON traversals to attempt to prove that weather gets hotter closer to the equator. There were 2 parts to this project, WeatherPy and VacationPy. WeatherPy utilises a python library called CitiPy and the OpenWeatherMap API, and scatterplots and linear regression are undertaken on relationships showcased in the data. VacationPy uses jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API to create a heatmap of humidity, and heatmap with markers for hotels and cities that are in my ideal weather conditions.
- The `/WeatherPy` folder contains the files examining the Scatterplots and linear regression.
- The `/VacationPy` folder contains the files for creating a humidity heatmap and hotel and city markers on heatmap of ideal weather conditions.
